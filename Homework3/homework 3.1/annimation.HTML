    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>This assignment should be solved with <em>animation</em> and without touching the HTML. Experiment with different solutions and read about them on the web. Some solutions are more performant than others and will look more smooth</p>
    <p>Don't overwrite the base CSS. Write your own CSS at the bottom of the stylesheet, after the comment.</p>
    <ol>
       <li>The animation should not start until 4 seconds after the page loads</li>
      <li>The ball should move in a square around the page.</li>
      <li>The ball should do this move three times clockwise/counterclockwise/clockwise.</li>
      <li>Every lap should take 4 seconds.</li>
      <li>You should set a timing-function that is not the default.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tip:</h3>
    <p>You can use <em>transform</em> to move stuff around and scale them more freely.</p>
